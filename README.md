# jupyter-notebooks

I like to keep a notebook of plotters, blotters and data beaters, so that I don't forget how to use them.


## Local setup with Jypter

This repository has its own dependencies for the visuals.

```
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```

We can then run Jupyter with.

```
jupyter notebook
```
